    <h1>All Along the Watchtower</h1>
    <p>Jimmy Hendrix</p>
    <div>There must be some kind of way outta here
    Said the joker to the thief
    There's too much confusion
    I can't get no relief 
    </div>
    <div>
    Business men, they drink my wine
    Plowman dig my earth
    None were level on the mind
    Nobody up at his word
    Hey, hey
    </div>
    <div>
    No reason to get excited
    The thief he kindly spoke
    There are many here among us
    Who feel that life is but a joke
    But, uh, but you and I, we've been through that
    And this is not our fate
    So let us stop talkin' falsely now
    The hour's getting late, hey
    </div>
    <div>
    All along the watchtower
    Princes kept the view
    While all the women came and went
    Barefoot servants, too
    Outside in the cold distance
    A wildcat did growl
    Two riders were approaching
    And the wind began to howl
    </div>
